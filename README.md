# Machine Learning Projects

Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects that I've developed as part of my learning journey. Each project explores a different machine learning concept, algorithm, or dataset.

---

## Overview

This repository includes six machine learning projects, covering topics such as regression, classification, clustering, and deep learning. Each project is designed to showcase various machine learning techniques and their applications.
